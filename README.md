**Identifying the Role of Social Media Platforms in Propagating Antisemitic Sentiments**

In the contemporary digital age, social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping public opinion and discourse. With the alarming rise in antisemitic sentiments globally, there is a pressing need to understand the influence of these digital platforms on such attitudes. This study aims to analyze how different social media platforms might contribute to the propagation of antisemitic views among their users.

The specific objectives of this analysis are:
1. To examine the extent to which users of various social media platforms harbor antisemitic attitudes. This includes assessing negative views towards Jewish people, stereotypes about Jewish power in the media, Holocaust perceptions, and related antisemitic tropes.
2. To compare the prevalence of these antisemitic attitudes among users who frequently engage with these platforms (more than 30 minutes a day) versus those who do not use them or use them minimally.
3. To identify which social media platform(s) have the highest concentration of users with antisemitic views, thereby potentially serving as significant conduits for the spread of such sentiments.

The analysis utilizes a dataset from a survey of 1,323 Americans under 30, encompassing responses from 47 states. It includes respondents' attitudes towards a series of statements that reflect common antisemitic sentiments. By aggregating and analyzing these responses, the study seeks to provide insights into the role of social media in the contemporary landscape of antisemitism, potentially guiding strategies for combating online hate and misinformation.
